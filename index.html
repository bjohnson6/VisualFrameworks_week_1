This page needs to include:
A Header: Your App Name
A Description: A very short sentence or paragraph (or tag line) that describes the app
A Call To Action: A prominent "ADD AN ITEM" button. You can say "ADD A DUNGEON", or "ADD A WORKOUT", or something to that effect if your items will all be of a certain thing. This can be a text link OR if you want to get creative you can create a nice image.
Link your "ADD AN ITEM" to your additem.html page. Make sure it links correctly!
Use what tags are appropriate for the content and structure of your page. Don't forget, like all HTML pages, you need to include doctype, html, head, meta, title, body tags. -->
